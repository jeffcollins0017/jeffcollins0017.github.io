											<h3 class="major">Cyber Security</h3>
											<p>My passion for tech derrived from information security. In 2019 I found cybersecurity and have pursuing it ever since. With the skills gained from the NOC such as; Splunk, Kubernetes, and Docker, along with self taught programs like; SNORT, Burpsuite, Kali Linux, NMAP, and Wireshark, I believe I have a strong understanding of security fundamentals. </p>

Here I was able to collaborate with other apprentices in teams, work and grow with Box as a junior NOC/SRE engineer, and code multiple projects for self development. </p>
